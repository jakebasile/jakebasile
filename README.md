# Jake Basile

Hello. I'm Jake Basile, and I write Clojure for a living. I was born in Akron, Ohio but I live in Austin, Texas. My hobbies include PC games, photography, and movies. I use GitHub for my job, but when I was young and had more free time I also had a few barely-noticeable open source projects on here.
